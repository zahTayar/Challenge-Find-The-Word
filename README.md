# ChallengeFindTheWord
Cyber Challenge- Beat the snake and get the word.\n
In every start of the game the random word is changed, and the player needs to guess it by beating the snake.
We can add a minimal time for the user success , but it suppose to be easy.
Every word has 12 letters so the player needs to eat 12 bites or 11 at least, because there is a similar words.
The solution can work only if the user gets letters.
Idea: read the letters from the user  and then read the words.txt to a list, and then mooving across the list to find the word.
After he found, He get the hidden flga.
